# Duck Library

> `>` Hello! This was my first ever, developed user-interface for anyone to use publicly as a library.

- This library is subject to change frequently and hopefully massively in the upcoming future, with all of the ideas and changes I want to update and make differently.

> `>` This library is public to anyone and everyone!

- If you would like, the source can be found [here](https://github.com/bruvzz/ducklibrary/blob/main/src.lua). You can change this also to however and whenever you feel like it.

- If you also want a brief documentation on how to use the library in action, please click [here](https://github.com/bruvzz/ducklibrary/blob/main/Documentation.md).

> `>` Library inspired by Vape Lib

- This library is inspired by developer [dawid#7205](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dawid-scripts). You can check out his other content and repositories by simply clicking his usertag!
